# FORTRIS Technical Test – SQL Section

This repository contains technical test solutions for the Application Support Engineer position at Fortris.

Each exercise is implemented in its own folder as a fully functional Dockerized PostgreSQL environment. The structure includes seed data, query files, and detailed documentation to demonstrate hands-on skills with SQL.

---

## How to Run All SQL Tests

1. Make sure you have Docker and `psql` installed.
2. In the project root, run:

   docker-compose up -d

3. Each test runs a separate PostgreSQL container mapped to a different local port:

   - sql-query-test-1 → Port 5432
   - sql-query-test-2 → Port 5434

4. To execute the query of each test:

   - **Test 1**:  
     psql -h localhost -U demo -d company -p 5432 -f sql-query-test-1/queries/query_employees.sql

   - **Test 2**:  
     psql -h localhost -U demo -d company -p 5434 -f sql-query-test-2/queries/query_headcount.sql

   Default credentials:

   - User: demo
   - Password: demo

## SQL Query Test 1 – Employees and Departments

**Objective**: Retrieve all employees with their job title and department name.

**Concepts demonstrated**:

- INNER JOIN between `employees`, `jobs`, and `departments`
- Clear relational schema using foreign keys
- Structured and readable query design

**Data overview**:

- Employees like Jennifer Whalen (Administration Assistant) and Michael Hartstein (Marketing Manager) are included
- Departments: Administration, Marketing, Purchasing
- Jobs: Assistant, Manager, Clerk, etc.

**Expected result**: 9 employees with their job title and department, correctly joined and grouped.

---

## SQL Query Test 2 – Department Headcount

**Objective**: Generate a report showing each department's headcount (number of employees), including those with no employees.

**Concepts demonstrated**:

- LEFT JOIN between `departments` and `employees`
- GROUP BY and COUNT aggregation
- ORDER BY in descending order of headcount

**Data overview**:

- 11 departments created with varying numbers of employees
- Headcounts range from 7 (Shipping) to 1 (Administration, Human Resources, etc.)

**Expected result**:  
A list of all 11 departments with accurate headcounts, descending by number of employees.

## 🧠 Exercise 3 - MongoDB: Querying the `orders` Collection

This exercise demonstrates how to query a MongoDB collection named `orders`, pre-seeded with a dataset using an `init.js` script. The collection stores transaction records with the following structure:

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("60b8d295f1a7f2355e9f1d8c"),
  "Date": ISODate("2024-06-20T15:30:00Z"),
  "Amount": 250.75,
  "txHash": "0xabcdef..."
}
```

### ✅ Run All Queries at Once

All queries from this exercise have been included in a single script for easy testing and validation.

📄 **Script path**: `mongo-query-test-3/queries/mongo-query.js`

You can execute the entire script with the following command:

mongosh --host localhost --port 27017 mongo-query-test-3/queries/mongo-query.js

## 🚀 How to Connect to test app with mongosh terminal

- mongosh --host localhost --port 27017
- use testdb

## 🔎 1. Get the Amount of a specific \_id

- db.orders.find(
- { \_id: ObjectId("60b8d295f1a7f2355e9f1d8c") },
- { \_id: 0, Amount: 1 }
- )

- Why use find?
- Since we're retrieving a single document by its \_id, which is indexed by default, find is the most efficient and readable choice. There's no need to use an aggregation pipeline unless we need additional transformation.

## 🔎 2. Filter orders from May 1 to June 1, 2024

- db.orders.find({
- Date: {
-     $gte: new Date("2024-05-01T00:00:00Z"),
-     $lt: new Date("2024-06-01T00:00:00Z")
- }
- })

- Why use find?
- This is a basic range query, ideal for find as no aggregation or data restructuring is needed.

- When to prefer aggregate?
- If you want to extract parts of the date (day, month, etc.) or apply post-filters. Example:

- db.orders.aggregate([
- {
-     $match: {
-       Date: {
-         $gte: new Date("2024-05-01T00:00:00Z"),
-         $lt: new Date("2024-06-01T00:00:00Z")
-       }
-     }
- },
- {
-     $project: {
-       _id: 0,
-       Date: 1,
-       Amount: 1,
-       dayOfMonth: { $dayOfMonth: "$Date" }
-     }
- }
- ])

## 🔎 3. Filter by Amount > 100 and sort by latest

- db.orders.find(
- { Amount: { $gt: 100 } }
- ).sort({ Date: -1 })

- Why use find + sort?
- We're only filtering and sorting, not transforming data. find is clearer and performant, especially if we create indexes on Amount or Date in production.

## 🔎 4. Aggregate total Amount of transactions per day

- db.orders.aggregate([
- {
-     $group: {
-       _id: {
-         $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m-%d", date: "$Date" }
-       },
-       totalAmount: { $sum: "$Amount" }
-     }
- },
- { $sort: { \_id: 1 } }
- ])

- Why aggregate is necessary:
- Grouping and summing fields per day is not possible with find. This is a textbook case for aggregation pipelines.

## 🔎 5. Count the number of transactions per day

- db.orders.aggregate([
- {
-     $group: {
-       _id: {
-         $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m-%d", date: "$Date" }
-       },
-       transactionCount: { $sum: 1 }
-     }
- },
- { $sort: { \_id: 1 } }
- ])

- Why aggregate is required:
- Again, since we are counting by grouping over formatted dates, only aggregate can handle this logic.

## 🐍 Exercise 4 - Python: Exporting Orders from MongoDB (It's inside exercise 3 since it's using Mongo DB)

This exercise demonstrates how to connect to a MongoDB collection, extract specific fields (`_id`, `Amount`, `Date`), map them to a Python class, and export the results to a CSV file. It also includes proper **exception handling**, **logging**, and **unit tests** to validate functionality.

### 🧾 Problem Statement

> Using the previous MongoDB collection example:  
> `{ "_id": "ObjectId('60b8d295f1a7f2355e9f1d8c'), "Date": "2024-06-20T15:30:00Z", "Amount": 250.75, "txHash": "..." }`
>
> Write a Python script that:
>
> - Connects to the MongoDB collection
> - Extracts the fields `_id`, `Amount`, and `Date`
> - Parses the results into a class
> - Creates a DataFrame
> - Exports it into a CSV file
> - Includes exception handling and logging

### 📂 Directory Structure

mongo-query-exercise-3/
└── python-exercise-4/
├── export_orders.py # Main script (entry point)
├── output.csv # Auto-generated CSV file
├── export_orders.log # Log file for debug

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

- The script connects to MongoDB at `mongodb://localhost:27017/`
- It reads from the database `testdb`, collection `orders`
- Documents are mapped to the `Order` class with fields:
  - `ID` (converted from ObjectId)
  - `Amount`
  - `Date`
- Results are exported to a CSV using `pandas`
- Logs are written to `export_orders.log`

## ⚙️ Exercise 5 - Exercise - Docker Swarm Essentials

Im executing this exercise in folder docker-swar-exercise.

This folder demonstrates key Docker Swarm operations using a basic `nginx` service.

## 1. What are the basic commands to manage Docker Swarm?

# Initialize Swarm mode on the manager node

docker swarm init

# Get token to join other nodes as workers

docker swarm join-token worker

# Join a node to the Swarm (run this on the worker node)

docker swarm join --token <worker-token> <manager-ip>:2377

# Deploy a stack using Docker Compose in Swarm mode

docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack

# List all nodes in the Swarm

docker node ls

# List all services running in the Swarm

docker service ls

# Inspect a specific service in a user-friendly format

docker service inspect <service_name> --pretty

## 2. How do you find a service in a manager?

# Run on the manager node:

docker node ls # List nodes in the Swarm
docker service ls # List active services

## 3. How do you list a service in a certain host?

# On the specific host:

docker ps # Show containers running on that host

# Or from the manager:

docker service ps <service_name> # Shows tasks and which node they're running on

4. How do you access a container?

docker ps # Get the container ID
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh # Or bash

# For Swarm services:

docker service ps <service_name> # Get the container/task ID
docker exec -it <task_id> /bin/sh

5. How do you retrieve the logs from a container and get the logs live?

# For a single container:

docker logs -f <container_id>

# For a Swarm service:

docker service logs -f <service_name>

6. How do you restart a service in Docker Swarm?

docker service update --force <service_name>

7. How do you update/create an environment variable for a certain service?

docker service update --env-add MY_VAR=value <service_name>

8. How do you scale a service?

docker service scale <service_name>=5 # Note: The default replica count in `docker-compose.yml` is 3, but the command below shows how to override and scale it to 5 at runtime.
